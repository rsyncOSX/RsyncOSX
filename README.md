This is [the repository for RsyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI), a SwiftUI based macOS application. RsyncUI is released for *macOS Sonoma and later*. RsyncUI is a GUI on the Apple macOS platform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks. The GUI is *only* for organizing tasks, setting parameters to `rsync` and make it easier to use `rsync`.
