This is [the repository for RsyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI), a SwiftUI based macOS application. RsyncUI is released for *macOS Sonoma and later*. RsyncUI is a GUI on the Apple macOS platform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks. The GUI is *only* for organizing tasks, setting parameters to `rsync` and make it easier to use `rsync`.

The [user documentation](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/)([repo](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rsyncuidocs)) is based upon a fork of the excellent Hugo based theme [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy). RsyncUI might be installed by Homebrew or by direct download. It is *signed* and *notarized* by Apple.
